    description: "Pumpkin soup on oil on a polar panel, hurled with a decisive gesture against Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The liquid strikes and slides toward the lower frame, tracing an orange veil. A performance executed by two members of Riposte Alimentaire and witnessed by dozens. The act reframes the painting as a silent witness to an agricultural system in crisis. Carried out with precision and accompanied by the shouted question: \"Art, or the right to healthy and sustainable food?\" Covered by international press including Le Monde, The Guardian, Vanity Fair, AP News, and circulated widely across social media.",

    concept: "Capitalism",
    description: "A controlled projection of mashed potatoes onto Claude Monet's Grainstacks by four activists from Letzte Generation. Executed with a two-handed forward throw at close range, targeting the centre of the canvas. The intervention recontextualises impressionist serenity within the urgency of collapsing ecosystems and fossil dependency. Widely featured across German and international media, from Der Spiegel to The New York Times. Detention rate: 100%. Charges filed: 0%.",

    concept: "Capitalism",
    description: "Viscous black oil on the \"oil on canvas\" surface of Gustav Klimt's Death and Life. The substance spreads slowly along the arc that divides mortality from ornament, saturating the transition between gold and grey. The protest was carried out by two activists from Letzte Generation Österreich during a free-admission day sponsored by Austrian oil company OMV. One applied the liquid; the other clung to the glass—together completing a denunciation of the ongoing expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure and its entanglement with public institutions. Extensively covered by Die Presse, ORF, The Art Newspaper, and Le Monde.",

    concept: "Capitalism",
    description: "Pea soup, warm and opaque, projected with abrupt force onto the sower oil on canvas. The substance strikes the central figure from below, rising diagonally through the composition and dispersing across the upper field—cutting through sky, grain, and gesture. Applied by two members of Ultima Generazione, the act merges alimentary matter with painterly tradition, contaminating pastoral rhythm with the weight of future famine. Broadcast widely across RAI, La Repubblica, and Il Messaggero.",

Extensive artistic and media coverage, including The Guardian, BBC, CNN, and Le Monde within 24 hours. A pioneering icon of contemporary climate protest, and a clear influence on subsequent interventions across Europe.",

    description: "Red paint applied freehand onto Claude Monet's The Artist's Garden at Giverny, followed by the physical adhesion of two activists from Restore Wetlands. The mark spreads laterally across the central foliage, interrupting the canvas with an imprint that reads both as wound and signature. The phrase \"This garden will soon be a thing of the past\" underscores the protest: a denunciation of the accelerated loss of wetlands and ecosystems in the face of climate change. Covered by Le Monde, France 24, Hyperallergic, and The Art Newspaper. Detention rate: 100%.",

A layer of food product delivered by two members of Riposte Alimentaire, replacing atmosphere with opacity.

    concept: "Capitalism",
    description: "Blue permanent marker and industrial adhesive, directly applied to the glazed surface of Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans, synthetic polymer paint on five canvases. Executed by two climate activists, the gesture interrupts Pop Art's polished repetition with scrawled immediacy—commodity aesthetics disrupted by hand-drawn urgency. The intervention reframes supermarket iconography not as abundance but as warning, attaching protest both literally and conceptually to the work. Covered by The Guardian, Australian broadcasters, and widely circulated across international media and social platforms.",
